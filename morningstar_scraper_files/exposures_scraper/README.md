# MorningStar Exposures Scraper

This project aims to collect the different exposures of the funds from morningstar, including:

1. Liquidity Exposures
2. Countries Exposures
3. Sector Expsures
4. Top Holdings

**To ensure the scraping speed and minimize the error when scraping, I have split each exposure's scraper into different files, please run them seperately and use the ..py to merge them**
